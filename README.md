## Professional Profile
I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong academic and research background in **Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My research focuses on developing data-driven intelligent systems, with particular emphasis on **multilingual sarcasm detection using Bengali, English, and Banglish textual data**.

I have experience working with real-world datasets, applying deep learning and transformer-based models, and conducting empirical evaluation of machine learning classifiers. My long-term objective is to pursue advanced research and contribute to impactful AI-driven solutions in healthcare, education, and intelligent systems.
